# Smart Packing App for Smart Cities

### **Overview**

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an Android application designed to enhance user interaction with smart robots. Developed with the concept of smart cities in mind, this app allows users to select products that can be packed together by a smart robot. Specifically, it was configured for the **Smart City Competition 2019** held in Milton Keynes, where HBRS robots packed candies.

The app serves as an intuitive interface to bridge the gap between users and robots, demonstrating the potential of automation and robotics in smart cities.

### **Key Features**
