# sdp_2018wt_P8_SmartCityApp

## Description
* This repository contains the android application source code plus documentation.
* Keeping smart cities in mind, this app is developped so that a user can select products that can be packed together by a smart robot.
* Now this app is specifically configured for the Smart City competition event to be held in 2019 in Milton Keynes where the products are candies which are to be packed by the HBRS robots.
* This app serves as an interface to reduce the gap between the users and the robots.
